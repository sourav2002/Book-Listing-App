#Layout
------------


Overall Layout
--------------

App contains a ListView which becomes populated with list items.



List Item Layout
-----------------

List Items display at least author and title information.


Layout Best Practices
---------------------

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
- Text sizes are defined in sp
- Lengths are defined in dp
- Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.


Text Wrapping
--------------

Information displayed on list items is not crowded.


Rotation
--------

Upon device rotation:

- The layout remains scrollable.
- The app should save state and restore the list back to the previously scrolled position.
- The UI should adjust properly so that all contents of each list item is still visible and not truncated.
- The Search button should still remain visible on the screen after the device is rotated.



#Functionality
-------------


Runtime Errors
--------------

The code runs without errors.


API Call
---------

The user can enter a word or phrase to serve as a search query. The app fetches book data related to the query via an HTTP request from the Google Books API, using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.


Response Validation
------------------

The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and responds appropriately. The result of the request is validated to account for a bad server response or lack of server response.


Async Task
------------------

The network call occurs off the UI thread using an AsyncTask or similar threading object.


JSON Parsing
------------

The JSON response is parsed correctly, and relevant information is stored in the app.


ListView Population
-------------------

The ListView is properly populated with the information parsed from the JSON response.


No Data Message
---------------

When there is no data to display, the app shows a default TextView that informs the user how to populate the list.


External Libraries and Packages
--------------------------------

The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries for core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.



#Code Readability
-----------------


Naming conventions
------------------

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.


Format
------

The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
